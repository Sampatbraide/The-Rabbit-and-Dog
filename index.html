  <h1>My Best Pet is “The Rabbit and Dog”</h1>
  <p> Among all the animals I have encountered, rabbits and dogs hold a special place in my heart. Their personalities may differ, but they both bring joy, comfort, and companionship in unique ways. Rabbits are gentle, quiet, and surprisingly expressive, while dogs are loyal, energetic, and always eager to play. I love watching them interact—sometimes the rabbit hops around curiously while the dog patiently observes. Their bond is a beautiful example of harmony between species. Whether it is cuddling with my dog after a long day or feeding my rabbit fresh greens, these pets make life richer and more meaningful.</p>
